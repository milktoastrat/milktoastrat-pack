<h1 align="center">MilkToastRat Pack</h1>

**MilkToastRat Pack** is a free and open-source icon pack designed for use in game libraries, launchers, frontends, and retro emulation projects. It includes clean, consistent icons in multiple formats (`.svg`, `.png`, `.ico`) to support a wide variety of platforms and use cases.

The **MilkToastRat Pack** focuses on accuracy, aesthetic balance, and high visual clarity—whether you're customizing a frontend like [RomM](https://github.com/rommapp/romm) or just want a better-looking platform grid. New icons are added whenever I feel like it.

## How to Use

1. **Download the icons**  
    Browse the repo and download the icons you need — or just clone the whole pack:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/milktoastrat/milktoastrat-pack.git
    ```

2. **Choose your format**  
    Icons are available in three formats:

    - `.svg` – best for scaling and editing  
    - `.png` – great for most frontends and file explorers  
    - `.ico` – for the brave souls still customizing Windows shortcuts  

3. **Drop them into your project**  
    You can use the icons in:

    - Frontends like [RomM](https://github.com/rommapp/romm)  
    - Launchers (Playnite, SteamGridDB Manager, etc.)  
    - Custom folders, shortcuts, tattoos, whatever who cares
